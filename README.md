Googleâ€™s Flutter team has been partnering with the Google News Initiative (GNI) in releasing the Flutter News Toolkit, a free, prebuilt Flutter app template to accelerate news application development.

Flutter News Toolkit aims to **reduce the time to develop a typical news app by 80%**.

The Flutter News Toolkit:

- Contains common news app UI workflows and core features built with Flutter and Firebase
- Implements best practices for news apps based on [Google News Initiative research](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/info/assets/static/docs/nci/nci-playbook-en.pdf)
- Allows publishers to monetize immediately with pre-built Google Ads and subscription services
